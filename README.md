# Code Refactor Starter Code
- Added a website decription in place of "title"
- Changed image src code to include alt tags describing the image
- removed an ending /img> that was not necessary
- added an id to line 36 so that the link on line 16 would work
- changed line 53 60 and 67 to h2 to match its structure
- changed the css for benefit lead, brand and cost. They were marked as h3, I changed them to h2, but then the website font was too large. I went into the page source after reverting them back to h3 to copy what the font size was, then rechanged them back to h2 and put the elements into the css for each of them ie font size.

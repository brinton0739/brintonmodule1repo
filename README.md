# Code Refactor Starter Code
- Added a website decription in place of "title"
- Changed image src code to include alt tags describing the image
- removed an ending /img> that was not necessary
- added an id to line 36 so that the link on line 16 would work
- changed line 53 60 and 67 to h2 to match its structure
- changed the css for benefit lead, brand and cost so that when they were changed to h2 in the html is didn't change how the website looked.
